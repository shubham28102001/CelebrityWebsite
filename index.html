            <p class="intro">Paul William Walker was an American actor. He is best known for his role as Brian O'Conner
                in the Fast & Furious franchise.
                Walker began his career as a child actor during the 1970s and 1980s, gaining recognition in the early
                1990s after appearing in the television soap opera The Young and the Restless; he received praise for
                his performances in the teen film She's All That and the coming-of-age film Varsity Blues (both 1999),
                before gaining international fame after starring in The Fast and the Furious (2001).
                Walker then starred in the commercially successful road thriller Joy Ride (2001), which led to a
                reputation as an action star. He then continued with his performances in box-office disappointments Into
                the Blue (2005) and Running Scared (2006). Walker also earned praise in other genres, like in the
                survival drama Eight Below, and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen the war film Flags of Our Fathers (both
                2006). Outside of these, Walker then largely appeared in low budget action films, but starred in the
                commercially successful heist film Takers (2010).
                Walker died on November 30, 2013 at age 40 as a passenger in a single-car crash alongside friend and
                driver Roger Rodas. The accident is believed to have been caused by driving into a gas pipe. Walker's
                father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in
                settlements. At the time of his death, Walker did not complete filming Furious 7 (2015), which was then
                completed after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, filled in for Walker. The
                song "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned for the film's soundtrack as a
                tribute to Walker.

                    The last film of The Fast and the Furious franchise to feature Brian O'Conner, we had to include it
                    on this list. Fast 7 was a good way to say goodbye to Paul, as his character goes on one last
                    mission to save a hacker and take down Shaw for killing one of their own before settling down into a
                    normal life with Mia and their children. The touching final moments in which there is a flashback to
                    moments with Brian, and how he and Dom say goodbye to one another before driving off in different
                    directions are symbolistic. Like Dom says, "it's never goodbye."

                    Hours features Paul Walker as Nolan Hayes, a new father that loses his wife due to childbirth in
                    2005 just before Hurricane Katrina strikes New Orleans. Nolan is left to his own devices to keep his
                    newborn daughter alive in a ventilator after everyone, including doctors and nurses, are evacuated.
                    When the power goes out, Nolan has to use a hand-cranked generator to keep the ventilator running,
                    all the while fighting off looters, trying to find help, and struggling to keep himself awake. With
                    all the obstacles against him, Nolan relies on illusions of his wife and his love for his daughter
                    to keep him going, until help finally does arrive. It's a touching story about love and the will to
                    survive despite everything going wrong, and Walker's performance was strong, on-point and
                    incredible.

                    In the early '90s, Jerry Shepard (Walker) is a guide at an Antarctica research base. A UCLA
                    professor arrives at the base and pushes Shepard to take him to Mount Melbourne to find a rare
                    meteorite from Mercury. The trip goes badly, with the professor injured. Shepard and the professor
                    are rescued, forced to leave the dogs behind. Shepard, believing the pilot will return within days
                    for the dogs, ties them up securely. Unfortunately, it's months before Shepard can return, and he
                    spends that time trying to fund an expedition to retrieve them, something that the professor
                    actually contributes to. We get to see how the dogs survive the conditions and the loss of two of
                    their own, and the joyful reunion between Jerry and the remaining six. It's a heart-wrenching movie
                    that can be stressful but does contain a happy ending.
